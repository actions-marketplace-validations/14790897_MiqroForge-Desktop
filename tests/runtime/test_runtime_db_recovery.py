"""Regression tests for the runtime.db write-lock failure (#1012).

The CI flake was: a turn task cancelled while aiosqlite had already produced a
cursor but had not yet handed it to ``async with db.execute(...)``.  The cursor
was never closed, so the connection kept a stale WAL read snapshot and every
later write on it failed with ``SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT`` ("database is locked")
*instantly* — ``timeout=30`` is bypassed for a stale snapshot.

These tests pin both halves of the fix:

* prevention — cancelling the caller must not cancel (or strand) the operation;
* recovery — a connection that is already poisoned must be recycled instead of
  keeping the store write-dead forever.
