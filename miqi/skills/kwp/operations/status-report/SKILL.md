## If Connectors Available

If **No project tracker connected — use `write_file` and `edit_file` to maintain local project files, or `exec` to run CLI tools** is connected:
- Pull project status, completed items, and upcoming milestones automatically
- Identify at-risk items and overdue tasks

If **No chat platform connected — use the current conversation or the `message` tool if configured** is connected:
- Scan recent team discussions for decisions and blockers to include
- Offer to post the finished report to a channel

If **No calendar connected — describe your schedule and meetings manually, or use `exec` to check local calendar files** is connected:
- Reference key meetings and decisions from the reporting period

## Tips

1. **Lead with the headline** — Busy leaders read the first 3 lines. Make them count.
2. **Be honest about risks** — Surfacing issues early builds trust. Surprises erode it.
3. **Make decisions easy** — For each decision needed, provide context and a recommendation.
