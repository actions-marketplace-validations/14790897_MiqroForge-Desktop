"""Shared SQLite access layer for the runtime stores.

Why this module exists (#1012)
-----------------------------
``LedgerRuntime``, ``HistoryRuntime`` and ``ThreadRuntime`` each keep one
long-lived aiosqlite connection to the same ``runtime.db``.  aiosqlite runs
``db.execute(...)`` like this::

    cursor = await self._execute(self._conn.execute, sql, parameters)  # core.py:223
    return Cursor(self, cursor)

``_execute`` hands the statement to a worker thread and then awaits a future
(``core.py:160``).  If the calling task is cancelled **after** the worker has
produced the cursor but **before** the task resumes, the future stays finished
with the raw ``sqlite3.Cursor`` as its result, while the task raises
``CancelledError`` at that await.  The ``async with db.execute(...)`` never
attaches the cursor, so it is never closed.

An unclosed cursor keeps its statement active, which keeps the connection's
WAL read snapshot pinned.  Once any other connection commits, every later
write on that connection fails with ``SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT`` — reported as
``database is locked`` — *instantly*, because SQLite deliberately skips the
busy handler for a stale snapshot.  ``timeout=30`` cannot help, and a failed
write does not clear the snapshot: the connection stays write-dead.

Two defences live here:

1. **Prevention (load bearing).** Every statement runs inside
   :meth:`RuntimeDb.run`, which executes the operation in its own task and
   shields it.  Cancelling the caller can no longer interrupt a statement in
   flight, so no cursor can be orphaned in the first place.
2. **Recovery (safety net).** If a statement still fails with a stale-snapshot
   lock error, :meth:`RuntimeDb.run` recycles the connection so that later
   operations are not poisoned, and replays the operation once — but only when
   the failed attempt had not already modified rows.

Ordinary write-lock contention is *not* retried and *not* masked: it waits for
the busy timeout as before and then propagates.

Invariants worth relying on (#1012 review)
------------------------------------------
* **No use-after-close.** An operation holds ``_lock`` for its whole duration
  and :meth:`RuntimeDb.close` takes the same lock before detaching the
  connection, so an operation that outlived a cancelled caller always finishes
  against a live connection. An operation that has not started yet when
  ``close`` runs sees ``_db is None`` and fails loudly instead.
* **Replay is transaction-atomic.** A stale-snapshot failure is only replayed
  when the connection modified nothing, and ``total_changes`` counts writes
  that a later ``ROLLBACK`` undid — so a partially applied transaction can
  never look untouched and get replayed.

Journal mode
------------
``journal_mode=WAL`` is attempted on every (re)open and retried briefly, but a
database that cannot use WAL (some network filesystems) is not fatal: the
store continues in rollback-journal mode, which :attr:`RuntimeDb.health`
reports as ``wal_mode: false``.  That is a *degraded compatibility mode* —
``SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT`` is a WAL concept, so the stale-snapshot recovery path
cannot apply there.  Stranding is still prevented, because that comes from
shielding the operation, not from the journal mode.
