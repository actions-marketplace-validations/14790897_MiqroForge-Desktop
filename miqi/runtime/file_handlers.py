"""File artifact handlers for AppServer dispatch.

Phase 30: Migrates files.tree, files.read, files.write, files.delete,
files.diff, files.revert, and files.accept from bridge legacy handlers
to AppServer async handlers with client-scoped ownership enforcement.

Key semantics:
- All file operations (except files.tree without session_key) require
  client_id and verify session ownership via SessionManager.
- files.tree: workspace tree only when no session_key; session-scoped
  tree when session_key is provided and owned by client.
- files.read/write/delete: session ownership required for session-scoped
  paths; workspace-only paths are OK without ownership.
- files.diff/revert/accept: session ownership required; snapshots are
  resolved through the ownership-aware path resolver.
- Path resolution is centralized through _resolve_session_files_path()
  and _resolve_session_snapshot_dir() — no raw session_key concatenation
  in handler code.
- Bug fixes:
  1. _remove_tracked_file: was undefined — uses SessionManager.remove_tracked_file
  2. _reset_tracked_file_op: was bypassing ownership — now passes client_id
  3. files.write: tracked_files write was bypassing ownership — now passes client_id
