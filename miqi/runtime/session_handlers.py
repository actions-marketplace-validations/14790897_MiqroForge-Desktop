"""Session handlers for AppServer dispatch.

Phase 28.4: Migrates sessions.list, sessions.get, sessions.delete,
sessions.archive, sessions.unarchive, sessions.list_archived,
sessions.get_tracked_files, and sessions.clear_tracked_files from
bridge legacy handlers to AppServer async handlers.

Key semantics:
- sessions.list: merges active (AppServer registry) and inactive (disk)
  sessions for the requesting client. Active sessions show "running" status.
- sessions.get: checks AppServer registry first, falls back to SessionManager.
- sessions.delete: stops RuntimeSession if active, cleans AppServer registry,
  destroys sandbox, removes disk files.
- sessions.archive: stops RuntimeSession if active, cleans sandbox,
  marks archived on disk.
- Pure metadata handlers (unarchive, list_archived, tracked_files) remain
  thin wrappers but are gated through AppServer boundary.

      app-home stub changed state: sessions.archive marks the stub archived
      before resolving the folder copy, so an active-only listing would drop
