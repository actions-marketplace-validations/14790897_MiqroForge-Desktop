# ── session files layout ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# The per-session files root is ``<workspace>/sessions/<key>/files``.  Tools
# are handed that directory as their *workspace*, while the agent often
# writes paths relative to the workspace BASE (``sessions/<key>/files/...``).
# Normalizing the second form into the first is a rule every resolving layer
# must agree on: the office document tools and the agent file tools each grew
# their own answer and the two disagreed, so a declared deliverable was
# resolved to a doubled ``files/sessions/<key>/files/...`` path that never
# existed (#1131).  Both now import the one implementation below.  It lives
# here because this module is stdlib-only and importable from every layer
# without dragging in ``miqi.session.manager`` (see the note in
# ``miqi.session.session_keys``, which owns the key → directory-name half).
