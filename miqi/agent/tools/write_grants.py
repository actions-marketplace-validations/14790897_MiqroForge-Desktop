"""Session-scoped write grants shared by the file tools and ``exec`` (#1013).

``#864``'s write-authorization card records its SESSION-scoped answers
("本目录不再询问" / the approval-bypass switch) on the *file-tool instances* —
``WriteFileTool._granted`` / ``EditFileTool._granted`` /
``ApplyPatchTool._granted``, shaped ``dict[session_key -> {normcase(path)}]``.
``ExecTool`` holds no reference to those sets: its write boundary only honours
the harness-injected ``_user_roots`` (#821/#984, layers 1 and 3 —
``_exec_rw_binds`` and ``_guard_write_roots``), so the very same session's
``exec`` refused to write a directory the user had just authorized — the
residual gap ``ExecTool._exec_rw_binds``'s docstring recorded as "the #864
approval-card grants are deliberately NOT part of the exec set" until #1013
closed it through the store below.

This module is the process-level bridge.  The file tools publish every
session-scoped grant here (both grant points live in
``filesystem._resolve_write_shared_roots``, the single funnel all three write
tools share), and ``ToolOrchestrator._execute_in_sandbox`` merges
``get(session_id)`` into the ``_user_roots`` injection that ``exec`` already
trusts.  No new channel is invented: the store only feeds the one authorization
channel the sandbox already treats as harness-owned.

Invariants (fail-closed — this store only ever ADDS roots):
  * only SESSION-scoped grants are published.  "允许本次" (``once_granted``)
    is invocation-scoped and must never reach this store, or one "once" would
    widen every later ``exec`` in the session.
  * the key space is the tool session key, normalised exactly like the file
    tools' ``_session_granted`` (``None`` and ``""`` are the same bucket), so
    both sides agree on which session a grant belongs to.
  * ``get()`` never returns ``None``: an unknown session — or an empty store —
    is an empty ``frozenset``, so with nothing granted the injected
    ``_user_roots`` list is byte-for-byte what it was before #1013.
