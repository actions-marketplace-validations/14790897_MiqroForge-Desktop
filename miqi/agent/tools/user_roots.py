"""User-mentioned output directories — dynamic extra roots (issue #821).

When a user asks "结果输出到 C:\\Users\\x\\Desktop\\test_result\\<dir>",
the file tools must be able to read/write there even though the directory
is outside the workspace and not listed in ``tools.extra_roots``.  This
module extracts absolute directory mentions from the user's own messages so
the runtime can authorize them for the session (per tool call, never
persisted).

Security model:

- ONLY the user's message text is scanned — never model output, tool
  results, or documents (prompt injection via file content cannot grant
  roots).
- A mentioned path becomes a root as: itself when it is (or is intended
  as) a directory — including a not-yet-created one, so "输出到 新目录"
  works on the first write; the parent directory when it is an existing
  file.
- Mentions that would cover the host config, per-session files, the user
  profile root, a drive root, or a top-level system directory are dropped.
- Roots are capped (``max_roots``) per extraction; callers re-extract each
  turn so authorization never outlives the user's request.
