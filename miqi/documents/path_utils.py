"""Shared path-resolution helpers for office document tools (docx/pptx/xlsx/pdf).

All office write/read tools are registered with the per-session files
directory as both *workspace* and *allowed_dir* (see
``tool_registry_factory._write_workspace``).  Relative paths therefore
resolve against the **session files root**
(``<workspace>/sessions/<session_key>/files``).

The agent sometimes passes paths that were written relative to the
*workspace base* (the root containing ``sessions/<key>/files/...``), e.g.
``sessions/desktop_xxx/files/_ai_pest_run/step7_report/report.pdf``.
Naively joining that onto the session files root produces a nested
``files/sessions/desktop_xxx/files/...`` location (issue #806).
``resolve_output_path`` detects this prefix for the *current* session and
normalizes it away; prefixes that point at *another* session are rejected.

    Path semantics (documented for agents):

    - Relative paths resolve against *workspace* — for session-scoped tools
      that is the **session files root**
      (``<workspace_base>/sessions/<key>/files``).
    - Paths starting with ``sessions/<key>/files/`` were written relative to
      the **workspace base**.  When ``<key>`` is the current session the
      prefix is stripped so the file lands in the session files root instead
      of being nested under it (#806).  Prefixes pointing at another session
      are rejected.

    lets a document tool read and embed files outside the workspace (issue
    #1005 节 2, same class of hole as #994 H1 for ``create_pdf``).

    Resolution order, fail-closed:

    1. :func:`resolve_output_path` — workspace / session files root, with the
       workspace-base prefix normalization and cross-session rejection.
    2. User-authorized directories (``_user_roots``, the #821 injection),
       **only** when *allow_user_roots* is true and roots were actually
       injected.  Absolute paths only — a relative path that failed step 1 is
       never joined onto a user root.

    Anything else raises :class:`PermissionError`; callers must skip the file
    rather than embed it.
